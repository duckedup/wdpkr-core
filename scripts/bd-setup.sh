# tracked `sync.remote`, rejects its `git+ssh://` form as "not a Dolt remote",
# and so never reaches its own
# refs/dolt/data branch — leaving a fresh clone with an EMPTY tracker and no
# error naming the cause. An empty database then reads as divergent history, and
# the recovery `bd dolt pull` offers is `bd dolt push --force`, which would
# force-push nothing over everyone's issues.
#
# The ref holds a raw Dolt NBS store (a `manifest` plus `.darc` table files),
# which is exactly the layout of a `file://` Dolt remote — so it can be cloned
# directly once extracted.
